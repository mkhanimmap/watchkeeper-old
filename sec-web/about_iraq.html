<h1>Country Risk Profile Iraq</h1>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Terrorism, sectarian conflict and unabated crime causes a very unstable security environment in Iraq, especially in the central and southern parts of the country.  The Kurdish Region is more stable.</p>  
<p>Continuity of operations and staff welfare are further threatened by unpredictable operational challenges such as corruption, protests, poor infrastructure and traffic.  </p> 
<p>iMMAP’s American background and it’s support to government institutions further threaten operations and staff.</p>      
<p>Due to the poor state of the security forces I/NGOs must be able to supply protection and security management for themselves and ensure that they are prepared to deal with emergencies and other contingencies.</p>
<p>The iMMAP assessed Country Risk rating is assessed as HIGH.</p>
<h3>Terrorism / conflict</h3>
<p>Terrorism continues to be a significant security risk across Iraq, with the exception of the Kurdistan Region (KR).  Numerous armed militias, criminal organisations and transnational terrorist groups operate in the country.  Fatal attacks against both military and civilian targets, including government infrastructure, police stations, checkpoints, foreign diplomatic missions, markets and places frequented by foreigners such as hotels, are common. </p>
<p>Although the capacity of the Sunni insurgency has diminished since 2007, Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) retains the capability and intent to stage regular attacks, generally with the aim of undermining the country's Shia-led government.  Attacks by AQI tend to occur in waves, with a series of attacks taking place across the country followed by a lull of three to four weeks.  It is believed that a lot of AQI militants are currently engaged in the hostilities in Syria.</p>
<p>A range of tactics is utilised by all militant groups including mortar fire, suicide bombings, small arms fire, roadside improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and vehicle-borne IEDs.  </p>
<p>Sectarian divisions continue to fuel tensions between the country's Shia community, which makes up an estimated 60% of the population, and the Sunnis (35%), who were politically dominant under former president Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>The security situation is less severe in Basra and some southern cities, and the situation in the Kurdistan Region is relatively stable.  General instability in the country is likely to persist for the foreseeable future because of the continuing sectarian conflict between elements of the Sunni and Shia Arab populations in central and southern areas, and competition between various Shia Arab militias in the south.</p>
<p>Iraq's relations with Turkey have been strained in recent years. The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the Kurdish Freedom Falcons (TAK) are known to use Kurdish areas in northern Iraq as safe havens to conduct attacks on Turkish military targets in south-eastern and eastern Turkey. This has led to a number of incursions into northern Iraq by the Turkish armed forces since late 2007.  </p>
<h3>Crime</h3>
<p>The security forces are stretched with ongoing political violence, constraining their ability to deal with crime. Many of the current criminals are former insurgents, likely with some experience at evading the authorities and many are desensitized and therefore more willing to engage in violent crime.</p>
<p>Violent crime is widespread and includes carjacking, robbery, kidnapping, rape and murder.  Most crime affects local Iraqis because foreign organisations tend to have stringent security measures around their premises and residential compounds. </p>
<p>Kidnappings by criminal and terrorist groups are frequently reported. Kidnapping of Iraqi civilians is widespread, particularly in the capital Baghdad.  Most are conducted for financial gain.  Locals are at the greatest risk of being abducted.  This is mainly due to the fact that foreigners take strict measures and employ extensive security.</p>
<p>Carjacking and banditry occur frequently on roads between major cities, particularly on routes to Baghdad from Kuwait, Syria and Jordan. Robbers often kill vehicle occupants and steal vehicles and/or the goods they are carrying.</p>
<p>Crime levels are highest in Baghdad. Crime rates are lower in the Kurdistan Region (KR) because of the higher capacity of the Kurdish security forces to maintain rule of law.</p>
<h3>Operational</h3>
<p>The provision of law and order continues to be limited and the quality of Iraq's security forces varies greatly. In spite of increased capacity, the police force is still considered to be ethnically biased by many Iraqis and is broadly unpopular with several sections of the community.</p>
<p>Protests — especially in Baghdad, Basra and the KR — have been held over issues such as political reforms, corruption, economic instability, inadequate provision of essential services and high levels of unemployment.  Protests can also occur in reaction to international developments; for example, controversy surrounding an anti-Islamic film produced in the US triggered widespread demonstrations in September 2012. These are often boisterous and are liable to result in scuffles between participants and the security forces, with the latter often resorting to heavy-handed measures to disperse crowds.   Foreigners who have inadvertently driven into protests have been attacked — underlining the need to monitor local events closely through local sources.</p>
<p>Corrupt practices in Iraq - ranging from petty bribery to large scale misappropriation, expropriation, abuse of power and nepotism - are hampering both reconstruction efforts and attempts to improve the security situation.  Corruption among police and the security forces, including nepotism, graft and petty bribery to supplement salaries, is believed to be high, although improving.</p>
<p>Self-drive, except for the Kurdistan Region, is not recommended due to the threat of carjacking, armed robbery and random attacks.  Heavy congestion on major routes, poor lighting and low driving standards also increase the safety risk to motorists.  An international driving permit is required to drive in Iraq. </p>
<p>The standard of Iraq's infrastructure is improving but remains poor in most areas. Shortages and disruptions to power and water supplies are regularly reported and are potential catalysts for anti-government civil unrest.</p>
<p>Iraq is located in a seismically active zone. The country is also vulnerable to sand and dust storms.  Floods also occur occasionally. </p>
<p>Iraq experiences particularly high temperatures (averaging approximately 40 degrees Celsius) between May and October; precautions should be taken against heat stroke and exhaustion.  Sandstorms are also regularly reported and can lead to severe travel disruptions.</p>
<h3>Additional risks specific to iMMAP in Iraq</h3>
<p>There are strong anti-US/Western sentiments in the country.  Government institutions and installations are most frequented targeted by militants.  iMMAP’s American background and iMMAP’s support of government programs cause additional risks to operations.  </p>
