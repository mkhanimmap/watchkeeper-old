<h1>Country Risk Profile Pakistan</h1>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The security environment in Pakistan is extremely challenging with unabated levels of crime, terrorism and sectarian or political motivated violence, especially in the iMMAP area of operations.  Continuity of operations and staff welfare are further threatened by unpredictable operational perils such as traffic and deceases.</p>  
<p>iMMAP’s US background and the specific threat against (I)NGOs involved in (female) education programs causes further security challenges.</p> 
<p>The iMMAP assessed Country Risk Rating is HIGH.</p>      
<h3>Terrorism / conflict</h3>
<p>Pakistan continues to experience high levels of terrorism and Pakistan-based terrorist organizations continued to threaten internal, regional, and global security. Currently Pakistan ranks second on the Global Terrorism Index and the situation seems to be deteriorating.</p> 
<p>The majority of current militant operations, which can be credited to the Tehreek-i-Taleban Pakistan (TTP) and Al Qaeda cells, occur in Khyber Pakhtunkkhwa (KP) and the Federal Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) on the border of Afghanistan. However, major urban centres are also prone to terrorist attacks with a reported expansion of TTP operations in Karachi.</p>  
<p>The Pakistani security forces continue to conduct operations in areas with known terrorist activity but are unable to expand its operations to all areas of concern.  Military operations to counter terrorist activity cause an additional risk of collateral damage to staff operating in KP and FATA.</p>
<p>Violence resulting from both political and sectarian conflicts is strife throughout the country, with terrorist incidents occurring in every province.  Increased sectarian violence between the Sunni and Shia communities and intolerance against religious minority communities also result in numerous attacks with high casualty rates. These attacks continue the trend of targeted shootings, hand grenade attacks, suicide bombers and remotely detonated explosives to perpetrate violence. Attacks using similar methods are also carried out against government and police facilities.</p>
<p>Sectarian violence and/or the actions of armed wings of several political parties often result in public unrest, strikes or demonstrations and riots.  Especially funerals or public outrage after sectarian attacks repeatedly result in riots during which shootings, arson and clashes with security forces occur.  These events are highly unpredictable and can cause serious danger when staff members are in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
<h3>Crime</h3>
<p>Crime is significant in several major cities as well as rural areas.  This varies from ordinary theft to more serious crimes such as murder, violent robberies and hijackings, kidnapping for financial gain and extortion.  Often these crimes have a very violent character resulting in serious injuries or loss of life.  Major problems are caused by drugs related crime and the activities of extortion mafia and land grabbers.</p>  
<p>NGOs are often seen by criminal gangs as soft targets.  This is mainly caused by the fact that a lot of NGOs do not use armed secure whilst often carrying attractive goods.</p>
<h3>Operational</h3>
<p>There are several operational risks influencing iMMAP operations in Pakistan such as visa procedures, No Objection Certificates for visits to certain areas and erratic decisions by government institutions.  These inconsistent factors are highly unpredictable and can have severe impact on operations.</p> 
<p>Traffic accidents are a major concern.  Factors in rising road fatality and injury rates include inadequate emergency medical services, irresponsible driving, lack of knowledge of traffic laws, inadequate police enforcement, and poor road conditions.  Road conditions are often negatively influenced by poor maintenance, bad lighting, potholes and in rural areas roaming livestock.  During the winter months snow, rain and landslides caused by heavy rainfall can further decrease road conditions significantly.</p>
<p>There are several major health concerns.  Recent outbreaks of Measles and Polio are causing multiple casualties throughout the country, especially in the flood affected areas.  Rabies, Hepatitis A and B as well as Typhoid are common deceases and up to date vaccinations are required.  It’s also strongly recommended to check if the routine vaccinations are up to date (DTP, MMR and Polio).  All areas are prone to Malaria and it’s strongly recommended to take precautions.</p>
<h3>Additional risks specific to iMMAP in Pakistan</h3>
<p>There are strong anti-US/Western sentiments in the country and events such as blasphemous movies as well as the US drone operations in the border regions with Afghanistan fuel these sentiments.  iMMAP’s US background causes an additional risk to operations.</p>  
<p>Extremist militant groups recently have attacked (I)NGOs in Sindh province killing six polio vaccination staff in Karachi and kidnapping four NGO workers working on a UNICEF project.  The TTP has on multiple occasions stated their strong opposition against vaccination programs, female education and family planning and considers NGOs working in this field fair game.</p>  
<h3>Karachi</h3>
<p>Karachi continues to be the site of numerous incidents of terrorist, sectarian, ethnic, political, and criminal violence and is currently the most dangerous city of Pakistan. It is often difficult to determine who is responsible for specific incidents of violence. A variety of groups, including extremist religious elements from the Sunni and Shia sects and criminal elements from within local political organizations, appear to be involved in organizing and committing violent acts in the city.</p>
<p>The city experiences unabated levels of crime with violent robberies and abduction for ransom occurring multiple times per day.  The police and other security forces only maintain some form of law and order in approx 50% of the city.  The security situation in Karachi is an ongoing concern and rivalry point for political parties.</p>
<h3>Interior Sindh</h3>
<p>Armed assault, tribal clashes stemming from personal enmity and political rivalries are likely to remain major security concerns in addition to carjacking, highway robberies and abduction. The strong linkages that criminal groups in these rural areas have to influential landlords – thus being one of the key revenue generating components - they utilize road robberies, kidnappings, etc of softer targets (I/NGOs) as one of their more consistent revenue bases.</p>
